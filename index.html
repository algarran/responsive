                        Hi! First off I'd like to thank you for visiting my first repsonsive website using Bootstrap.
                        Bootstrap has been both exciting and frustrating at the same time but it is an amazingly
                        powerful tool.
                        A little about myself, I was born in Colorado which makes me... that's right, a life long
                        Broncos fan. I grew up an army brat and have
                        lived in many states as well as overseas for five years. I've called Kansas my home since 1999
                        when we
                        moved here from Germany. I've since started a family and have four children.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Some of my favorite hobbies are traveling, watching or playing any kind of competitive sport,
                        gaming, and listening to music. Some goals of mine are to continue to improve my fluency in
                        Spanish, pick up playing the piano again and to become an amazing developer!
                    </p>
